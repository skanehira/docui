## Configuration

### Command-Line Options

Support custom endpoint:

```sh
$ docui -h
Usage of docui:
  -api string
        api version (default "1.39")
  -ca string
        ca.pem file path
  -cert string
        cert.pem file path
  -endpoint string
        Docker endpoint (default "unix:///var/run/docker.sock")

Or set environment variables:

These environment variables take precedence over command-line options.
